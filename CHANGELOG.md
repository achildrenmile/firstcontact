## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-18

### Initial Release

First Contact is an interactive shortwave radio propagation simulator designed to teach how HF radio signals travel around the world.

### Features

#### Core Simulation
- **11 HF Bands**: 160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, 10m, 6m - each with realistic propagation characteristics
- **Real-time Day/Night Visualization**: See the terminator line move across the globe
- **Grey Line Propagation**: Experience the magic of twilight-zone enhanced propagation
- **Skip Zone Display**: Visual representation of the area signals cannot reach
- **Short Path & Long Path**: Automatic calculation of both propagation paths

#### Ionospheric Simulation
- **D-Layer Absorption**: Realistic daytime absorption of lower frequencies
- **F-Layer Reflection**: Proper F2 layer behavior for long-distance contacts
- **Solar Activity Levels**: Quiet, Normal, Active, Storm conditions
- **Season/Month Selection**: Affects daylight hours and ionospheric conditions

#### Special Propagation Events
- **Mogel-Dellinger Effect**: Solar flare radio blackouts on the sunlit side
- **Aurora**: Polar path disruption with characteristic flutter
- **Sporadic E**: Magic Band openings on 6m, 10m, 15m (500-2000km)

#### Station Configuration
- **Location Selection**: 100+ preset cities worldwide or custom coordinates
- **Transmit Power**: QRP (5W), Standard (100W), High Power (1kW)
- **Antenna Types**: Dipole, Vertical, Yagi with realistic gain and radiation patterns
- **Yagi Beam Direction**: 8-direction compass selector for directional antennas

#### Map Features
- **Interactive World Map**: Click anywhere to attempt a contact
- **Zoom & Pan**: Mouse wheel zoom, drag to pan
- **Maidenhead Grid Overlay**: Toggle to show amateur radio grid locator squares (AA-RR)
- **City Markers**: Visual markers for major cities worldwide

#### Educational Features
- **Interactive Tutorial**: 23-step guided introduction to propagation concepts
- **Detailed Help System**: Comprehensive explanations in English and German
- **Real-time Feedback**: Signal quality, path analysis, and propagation factors
- **Learning Points**: Contextual explanations of why contacts succeed or fail

#### Internationalization
- **English**: Full translation
- **German (Deutsch)**: Full translation

#### Technical
- **Pure Client-Side**: No server required, runs entirely in the browser
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop browsers
- **No Cookies/Tracking**: Privacy-friendly, only stores language preference locally
